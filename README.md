## Why FairLend Exists

Goldman Sachs and Apple were fined **$70 million** after their credit model produced discriminatory outcomes.  
The defense was familiar: *the model did not use gender directly*. That was not enough.

FairLend is built around the real problem:

| Problem | What Usually Happens | What FairLend Does |
|---|---|---|
| Proxy discrimination | Models learn bias through income, debt ratios, and other correlated signals | Measures proxy risk and constrains the model with Fairlearn |
| Black-box decisions | Teams cannot explain why an applicant was denied | Generates SHAP-based explanations and ECOA-ready adverse action letters |
| Compliance blind spots | Fairness checks happen late or not at all | Ships fairness audit, compliance chat, and EU AI Act reporting in one workflow |

---

## At a Glance

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Dataset | HMDA 2024 mortgage applications |
| Sample size | 500,000 real US applications |
| Best raw model | LightGBM, AUC-ROC `0.8402` |
| Legally safest model | LightGBM + Fairlearn, DPR `0.9025` |
| Live demo runtime | Synthetic fallback when raw HMDA CSV is unavailable |
| Explainability | SHAP per-applicant waterfall |
| Compliance tooling | ECOA letters, NL to SQL chat, EU AI Act checklist |
| Demo status | Public demo link removed while the hosted Space is unavailable |
| Test suite | 34 passing pytest checks |

---

## Benchmark vs Live Demo

The repository documents two different operating modes, and they should not be mixed together:

| Environment | Data source | What it is for | What can differ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Full benchmark | 500,000-row HMDA 2024 sample | Model evaluation, documentation, repo claims | Best accuracy and fairness numbers |
| Demo configuration | Synthetic fallback when the raw CSV is not present | Local/product walkthrough mode | Dashboard metrics, fairness ratios, and EU AI Act status cards |

That means the **tables below are the full benchmark results**, while screenshots may reflect the demo configuration.

---

## The Core Result

These are the full-HMDA benchmark results from the local/research pipeline, not the synthetic demo fallback.

Three out of four trained models fail the fairness threshold even without race or sex being used as direct inputs.

| Model | AUC-ROC | F1 | DPR | EOD | Passes 0.80 DPR? |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Logistic Regression | 0.6756 | 0.6862 | 0.6683 | 0.1697 | No |
| Decision Tree | 0.8082 | 0.8905 | 0.7937 | 0.1752 | No |
| LightGBM | 0.8402 | 0.8888 | 0.7819 | 0.1622 | No |
| **LightGBM + Fairlearn** | **0.7111** | **0.9056** | **0.9025** | **0.0748** | **Yes** |

**Takeaway:** the highest-accuracy model is not the safest model. FairLend makes that tradeoff explicit.

The current EU AI Act screenshot reflects the **live demo state**. In demo mode, the report can show **REVIEW REQUIRED (9/10)** even though the full benchmark environment documented in this repo reaches **COMPLIANT (10/10)**.

## What the App Does

| Page | Purpose | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| Model Comparison | Compares 4 models on accuracy and fairness | Shows the legal cost of optimizing only for AUC |
| Applicant Explorer | Scores one applicant and explains the decision with SHAP | Makes individual decisions transparent |
| Fairness Audit | Computes disparate impact and proxy correlations | Finds discrimination even when protected fields are excluded |
| Adverse Action | Drafts ECOA-style denial letters with Gemini | Turns model output into regulator-friendly communication |
| Compliance Chat | Converts plain English questions into SQL over HMDA data | Gives compliance teams direct access to evidence |
| EU AI Act Report | Produces an article-by-article checklist | Connects ML outputs to high-risk AI governance and can surface review gaps in demo mode |

---

## The Proxy Discrimination Story

Protected attributes are excluded from the model inputs. Bias still shows up through correlated financial features.

| Feature | Correlation with Race | Risk Level |
|---|---:|---|
| income | 0.175 | High |
| loan_to_income_ratio | 0.143 | High |
| dti_ratio | 0.115 | Medium |
| loan_amount | 0.100 | Medium |
| is_conventional | 0.034 | Low |

That is the point of FairLend: **removing race from the feature list is not the same as removing racial bias from the model**.
